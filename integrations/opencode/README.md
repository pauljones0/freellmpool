# freellmpool plugin for OpenCode

See which free provider/model is actually serving you, check usage and rate-limits,
and control routing quality — all from inside [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

It talks to a running [freellmpool](https://github.com/0xzr/freellmpool) proxy
(`freellmpool proxy`, default `http://localhost:8080`).

## What it adds

- **`freellmpool_status` tool** — usage and estimated $ saved, per-provider quota /
  rate-limit / cooldown / latency, the current routing mode, and the most-recently
  served provider+model. Pass `verbose: true` for per-model detail. Ask the agent
  things like *"check freellmpool status"* or *"how much quota is left?"*.
- **`freellmpool_models` tool** — lists the model ids the proxy exposes (including the
  routing aliases `agent` / `auto` / `spread` / `fast` / `quality` / `fair`).
- **`freellmpool_tokenmax` tool** 🌈 — fan the same prompt out to automatically eligible
  ranked targets across configured providers (hard cap 256; a max or routing policy may
  narrow the swarm), then the agent synthesizes the returned responses. Ask
  *"tokenmax: &lt;hard question&gt;"*. While the swarm runs, the companion **embedded TUI
  dashboard** (`../opencode-tui`) throbs a live rainbow `TOKENMAXXING` animation with
  `N/total` progress — install it too for the show.
- **pool activity toast** — after a freellmpool reply, a small toast shows the
  proxy's latest pool request. That status can belong to another concurrent
  request; it is not attributed to the current reply. Silence it with
  `FREELLMPOOL_TOAST=0`.

## Controlling routing (quality)

Routing is chosen by the **model name** in OpenCode's model picker — no extra config:

| Model | Routing |
| --- | --- |
| `freellmpool/agent` | **default for long agentic work** — stay in the strongest healthy benchmark tier, then spread quota and prefer fast targets inside that tier. |
| `freellmpool/spread` | spread across the *whole* pool (least-used tier first), with a latency/health tie-break. Use when breadth and maximum aggregate quota matter more than capability. |
| `freellmpool/auto` | proxy default (whatever `FREELLMPOOL_ROUTING` is set to) |
| `freellmpool/fast` | lowest-latency provider first (concentrates load → can rate-limit under sustained loops) |
| `freellmpool/quality` | match the model's capability to the prompt's difficulty |
| `freellmpool/fair` | spread load across providers (preserve quota), latency-blind |

**For agentic coding, pick `freellmpool/agent`.** It prevents weak-model stalls while
rotating among similarly capable targets. `spread` reaches deeper into the pool when
aggregate quota matters more than keeping every turn in the strongest tier.

(Advanced: send an `X-Freellmpool-Routing: agent|spread|fast|quality|fair` header instead.)

## Install

> **Registry publication status: pending.** `opencode-freellmpool` and its
> companion `opencode-freellmpool-tui` are pack/install/load-tested in CI, but
> neither package was published on npm as of 2026-08-29.
> Repository-local plugin sources are included in 0.12.0 with registry-readiness hardening
> and corrected defaults. Use the local-file path below until verified registry
> versions exist.

**Option A — local package (recommended until registry publication):**

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/integrations/opencode
npm pack
npm install --prefix ~/.config/opencode ./opencode-freellmpool-0.1.0.tgz
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugin ~/.config/opencode/tools
cp plugin/freellmpool.js ~/.config/opencode/plugin/
cp tools/*.js ~/.config/opencode/tools/
```

OpenCode auto-discovers the shim in `~/.config/opencode/plugin`; do not add the
unpublished package name to the `plugin` array, because that can trigger a
registry lookup. The files copied into `~/.config/opencode/tools` are required for OpenCode
versions that discover custom tools from that directory rather than from a
plugin's `tool` hook. Keeping both paths configured preserves the served-model
toast and exposes all three tools across supported OpenCode versions.

Then make sure the proxy is running (`freellmpool proxy`) and restart OpenCode.
The plugin's config hook adds the `freellmpool` provider and six routing aliases
to the resolved configuration without replacing your existing defaults.

Verify what the picker can see with `opencode models freellmpool`. If an older
OpenCode version does not support the config hook, copy the provider block
below into its configuration. The plugin never rewrites that file.

```jsonc
{
  "provider": {
    "freellmpool": {
      "name": "freellmpool (free pool)",
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://localhost:8080/v1",
        "apiKey": "{env:FREELLMPOOL_PROXY_KEY}",
        "headerTimeout": 600000,
        "timeout": 600000,
        "chunkTimeout": 120000
      },
      "models": {
        "agent": {},
        "spread": {},
        "auto": {},
        "fast": {},
        "quality": {},
        "fair": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration (env)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FREELLMPOOL_PROXY_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | proxy base URL |
| `FREELLMPOOL_PROXY_KEY` | _(none)_ | sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` if your proxy requires one |
| `FREELLMPOOL_TOAST` | on | set to `0`/`false`/`off` to silence the pool activity toast |

The plugin never throws on a down proxy — the tools return a short message and the
toast hook stays quiet.
