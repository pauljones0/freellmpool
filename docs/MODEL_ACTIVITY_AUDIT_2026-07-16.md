# Provider and model refresh — 2026-07-16

This maintenance pass checked the packaged catalog against provider-owned model
lists and documentation. Anonymous routes received a harmless `Reply with the
single word: pong` request where practical. Newly added keyed providers were
documentation-verified only because no credentials were available; they should
not be described as completion-tested.

## Catalog changes

| Provider | Evidence and action |
|---|---|
| LLM7 | Its public model list now includes `gpt-oss:20b`, which returned a keyless completion and was enabled. `gemma3:27b` repeatedly returned an unavailable-model response and was disabled. |
| OVHcloud AI Endpoints | The public list added `Qwen3-Embedding-8B`; its embeddings endpoint returned HTTP 200, so it was added to the embedding catalog. |
| Aion Labs | Added five current chat models from Aion's official model list. Aion documents an OpenAI-compatible API and a no-card free tier of 15 requests/minute and 20,000 tokens/day. |
| ModelScope | Added a curated set of seven current text-generation models. ModelScope documents its OpenAI-compatible API and a recurring 2,000-call daily allowance, dynamically limited to at most 500 calls per model. |

Result: **22 providers, 253 enabled chat routes, and 394 cataloged chat
models**. The catalog also contains non-chat capabilities such as embeddings,
speech, and image generation, so all-capability totals are higher.

## Candidates not added

- Together AI says it does not offer trials and requires a minimum credit
  purchase, so it is not a free-tier provider for this project.
- Fireworks prices inference per token. Its no-card account limits do not make
  inference free, so it was not added.
- Kilo's newly listed Kat Coder free route returned repeated 429 responses and
  remains unverified. Its content-safety classifier is not a general chat model.
- ModelScope exposes a much larger dynamic catalog; only current, general text
  generation routes were added to avoid presenting every listing as proven
  usable under the recurring free allowance.

Free tiers and model availability change without notice. Treat the packaged
catalog as a maintained routing snapshot, not a guarantee of future capacity.
